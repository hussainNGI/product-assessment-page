Notes / observations

1) I didn't get any link / button into the design file to navigate the next steps. so I just create the placeholder for Step 2 and step 3.

2) Designer used many shades of black and gray. It's hard to pick exact color code from JPEG. so I used two colors to design it.

3) As we have JPEG so we can't extract the font family so I used similar Google Fonts Family.

4) For the icons I am using the fontawesome CDN. if you provide the icons source then I will replace with them.

5) Location Pin image is blur right now as we extract the image from JPEG. we can update the image once we got source file in .psd, .xd, zeplin or figma.
